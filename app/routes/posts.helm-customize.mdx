## Introduction

Helm is a **package manager** for Kubernetes that helps you manage and deploy applications using **charts**—collections of templates that define Kubernetes resources. While Helm provides a vast library of pre-built charts, there are times when you need to create a custom chart to suit your specific application needs.

In this guide, we’ll walk through the process of **creating a custom Helm chart** from scratch. You’ll learn how to:

- Set up the chart structure
- Define your Kubernetes resources
- Customize the chart using `values.yaml`
- Deploy the chart to your Kubernetes cluster

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you should have:

- A Kubernetes cluster up and running
- Helm installed on your local machine
- kubectl configured to access your cluster

---

## Step 1: Create a New Helm Chart

Start by creating a new Helm chart using the `helm create` command:

```bash
helm create my-custom-chart
```

This command will generate a directory structure for the chart:

```bash
my-custom-chart/
├── Chart.yaml
├── values.yaml
├── charts/
├── templates/
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── _helpers.tpl
│   ├── hpa.yaml
│   ├── ingress.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   ├── serviceaccount.yaml
│   └── tests/
└── .helmignore
```

### Key Files and Directories:

- **`Chart.yaml`**: Metadata about the chart, such as its name and version.
- **`values.yaml`**: Default values for your chart, which can be customized during deployment.
- **`templates/`**: Contains Kubernetes resource templates that Helm will render.
- **`_helpers.tpl`**: A helper template for reusable code (like label formatting).

---

## Step 2: Customize the Chart

Let’s customize this chart to suit a simple Node.js web application deployment.

### Editing `Chart.yaml`

First, edit the `Chart.yaml` file to reflect your application’s metadata:

```yaml
name: my-custom-chart
version: 0.1.0
description: A Helm chart for deploying a custom Node.js application
maintainers:
  - name: Your Name
    email: your.email@example.com
```

### Editing `values.yaml`

In the `values.yaml` file, we define the default values that can be overridden during deployment. Here's an example configuration:

```yaml
# Application name and image
app:
  name: my-node-app
  image:
    repository: node
    tag: 16-alpine
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

# Service configuration
service:
  type: ClusterIP
  port: 80

# Resources
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "64Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
  limits:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "200m"

# Replicas
replicaCount: 2
```

In this example:

- We define the application’s Docker image (`node:16-alpine`).
- The service type is set to `ClusterIP`, exposing port `80`.
- Resource requests and limits are defined to manage pod resource consumption.
- The default number of replicas is set to `2`.

---

## Step 3: Customize the Deployment Template

Next, we’ll modify the `deployment.yaml` template to suit our Node.js application. This is where Kubernetes manifests are defined using Helm template syntax.

Open `templates/deployment.yaml` and edit it as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: { { include "my-custom-chart.fullname" . } }
  labels:
    app: { { include "my-custom-chart.name" . } }
spec:
  replicas: { { .Values.replicaCount } }
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: { { include "my-custom-chart.name" . } }
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: { { include "my-custom-chart.name" . } }
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: { { .Values.app.name } }
          image: "{{ .Values.app.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.app.image.tag }}"
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: { { .Values.resources.requests.memory } }
              cpu: { { .Values.resources.requests.cpu } }
            limits:
              memory: { { .Values.resources.limits.memory } }
              cpu: { { .Values.resources.limits.cpu } }
```

### Key Points:

- `{{ .Values }}` references the values defined in `values.yaml`.
- `{{ include }}` is used to call helper functions defined in `_helpers.tpl`.
- The container’s image, resources, and replicas are all pulled from `values.yaml`.

---

## Step 4: Customize the Service Template

Next, open `templates/service.yaml` and edit the file to define how the application will be exposed.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: { { include "my-custom-chart.fullname" . } }
  labels:
    app: { { include "my-custom-chart.name" . } }
spec:
  type: { { .Values.service.type } }
  ports:
    - port: { { .Values.service.port } }
      targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: { { include "my-custom-chart.name" . } }
```

Here, the service type and port are pulled from `values.yaml`.

---

## Step 5: Test the Chart Locally

Before deploying to your cluster, you can test the chart rendering using the following command:

```bash
helm template my-custom-release ./my-custom-chart
```

This will output the Kubernetes manifests as they would be rendered, without actually deploying them.

---

## Step 6: Deploy the Chart to Kubernetes

Now that your custom chart is ready, you can deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster.

To install the chart:

```bash
helm install my-custom-release ./my-custom-chart --namespace my-namespace
```

This will create a Helm release named `my-custom-release` in the `my-namespace` namespace.

To see the status of the release:

```bash
helm status my-custom-release --namespace my-namespace
```

---

## Step 7: Update the Chart

If you need to change values or update the chart, you can modify `values.yaml` or pass in new values via the `--set` flag.

For example, to increase the number of replicas:

```bash
helm upgrade my-custom-release ./my-custom-chart --set replicaCount=4 --namespace my-namespace
```

---

## Step 8: Roll Back Changes

If something goes wrong with the deployment, you can easily roll back to a previous version of the release:

```bash
helm rollback my-custom-release 1 --namespace my-namespace
```

This command reverts the release to revision `1`.

---

## Conclusion

Creating a custom Helm chart allows you to package your Kubernetes applications in a reusable and flexible way. By leveraging templates and configuration files like `values.yaml`, you can easily manage complex applications and scale them across environments.

With this guide, you should now be able to:

- Structure and customize your Helm chart
- Define Kubernetes resources as templates
- Deploy and manage your application using Helm

Helm's flexibility and power make it an essential tool in modern Kubernetes-based environments. Happy charting!
