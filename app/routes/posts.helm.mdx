## What is Helm?

Helm is a **package manager for Kubernetes** that simplifies the deployment and management of applications in Kubernetes clusters. It allows you to define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications. Helm packages, called **charts**, are templates of Kubernetes resources that can be customized with your own configurations.

If youâ€™ve ever struggled with writing raw Kubernetes YAML files, Helm can greatly simplify your workflow by providing reusable, parameterized templates.

---

## Why Use Helm?

Helm offers several key advantages over manually managing Kubernetes resources:

- **Reusable Configurations**: Charts can be reused across multiple environments with different configurations.
- **Easy Updates**: Helm makes it easy to update applications without having to rewrite Kubernetes manifests.
- **Version Control**: Helm charts are versioned, enabling you to roll back to previous versions if necessary.
- **Simplified Deployments**: Helm abstracts the complexity of Kubernetes YAML files and helps manage them more efficiently.

---

## Helm Basics

Helm has three main concepts:

1. **Charts**: A collection of YAML templates used to generate Kubernetes manifests.
2. **Releases**: A running instance of a Helm chart deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.
3. **Repositories**: Collections of Helm charts that can be shared and distributed.

---

### Installing Helm

Before you begin, you need to install Helm. You can install Helm using `brew`, a curl script, or download it directly from the [Helm website](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

```bash
brew install helm
```

Alternatively, for Linux:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

---

### Creating a Helm Chart

To create a new Helm chart, use the `helm create` command:

```bash
helm create my-chart
```

This generates a basic Helm chart template structure:

```bash
my-chart/
  Chart.yaml        # Metadata about the chart
  values.yaml       # Default configuration values
  templates/        # Directory containing Kubernetes YAML templates
  charts/           # Directory for chart dependencies
```

### Key Files

- **Chart.yaml**: Contains the name, version, and description of your chart.
- **values.yaml**: Default values for the chart templates, which you can override during installation.
- **templates/**: Contains your Kubernetes manifests that Helm will dynamically generate based on `values.yaml`.

---

## Installing and Deploying a Helm Chart

Once your chart is ready, you can install it to your Kubernetes cluster.

For example, to install the `my-chart` chart in the `my-namespace` namespace:

```bash
helm install my-release ./my-chart --namespace my-namespace
```

Here, `my-release` is the name you give to this specific deployment instance of the Helm chart.

---

### Customizing Chart Values

You can override the default `values.yaml` by providing a custom values file. For example:

```bash
helm install my-release ./my-chart -f custom-values.yaml --namespace my-namespace
```

Or, by providing individual values via the `--set` flag:

```bash
helm install my-release ./my-chart --set service.port=8081 --namespace my-namespace
```

This will override the `service.port` value in `values.yaml` and deploy the application with port `8081`.

---

## Managing Helm Releases

After deploying your application, you can check the status of your release:

```bash
helm status my-release
```

To list all running Helm releases:

```bash
helm list --namespace my-namespace
```

You can also upgrade your release with a new version or updated configuration:

```bash
helm upgrade my-release ./my-chart -f custom-values.yaml --namespace my-namespace
```

And, if something goes wrong, you can roll back to a previous version:

```bash
helm rollback my-release 1  # 1 is the revision number
```

---

## Real-World Example: Using Helm with NGINX

Letâ€™s install the **NGINX** Helm chart from the official Helm repository and customize its port from `80` to `8081`.

1. First, add the stable Helm repository:

   ```bash
   helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
   ```

2. Install the NGINX chart and override the default service port:

   ```bash
   helm install nginx bitnami/nginx --set service.port=8081 --namespace my-namespace
   ```

3. Verify that the service is running on port `8081`:

   ```bash
   kubectl get svc -n my-namespace
   ```

Now, your NGINX service will be available on port `8081` instead of the default port `80`.

## Conclusion

Helm provides a powerful way to manage Kubernetes applications with ease. By using reusable charts, parameterized configurations, and the ability to easily roll back, Helm streamlines the development and deployment process.

Whether you're managing simple applications or complex microservices, Helm allows you to automate and simplify your Kubernetes deployments.

Happy charting! ðŸš€
